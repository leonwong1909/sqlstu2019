*标题翻译：游戏玩法说明II*
``` mysql
Create table If Not Exists Activity (player_id int, device_id int, event_date date, games_played int)
Truncate table Activity
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('1', '2', '2016-03-01', '5')
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('1', '2', '2016-05-02', '6')
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('2', '3', '2017-06-25', '1')
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('3', '1', '2016-03-02', '0')
insert into Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) values ('3', '4', '2018-07-03', '5')
```
Table: `Activity`
``` mysql
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
(player_id,event_date) 是此表的主键.
此表显示某些游戏玩家的活动.
每一行都是某天使用某设备登陆并玩多个游戏(可能为0)的玩家的记录.
```
> Write a SQL query that reports the device that is first logged in for each player.
> The query result format is in the following example:
> 编写一个SQL语句，查询首次登陆的设备
> 查询结果格式如下表：

**解答：**
``` mysql
SELECT distinct player_id,device_id FROM Activity
	WHERE (player_id,event_date) IN(
		SELECT player_id,MIN(event_date) FROM Activity
		GROUP BY player_id)
```
